# Hello! \o

I'm a full-stack developer (more expertise with frontend), currently working as front-end developer with Vue.js ðŸ’š at Weni, an enterprise of the chatbots developing segment.

On the front-end, I've experience with Vue.js, ReactJS and Next.js, as well as JavaScript, TypeScript, CSS3 and HTML5.
I've experience with Node.js and PHP (Laravel and Symfony) on the back-end, and I also have knowledge of Elixir and Phoenix.

I'm currently studying ReactJS and Nextjs ðŸ’™ in my free time and my focus is on front-end development.
